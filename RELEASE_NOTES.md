### Version 2.2.1 (April 24, 2017)

* Fix NPE with Android Plugin - [Issue 111](https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-clover-plugin/issues/111)

### Version 2.2.0 (December 29, 2017)

Gradle 4.x compatibility release

* Add support for Gradle 4.x - [Issue 91](https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-clover-plugin/issues/91)

  Migrated all code to work on Gradle 4.4.1. Solved the issues with the new language specific classes directories by completing the work to solve the joint Groovy/Java compile.

* Avoid Joint Compilation of Java Sources by Groovy Compiler- [Issue 55](https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-clover-plugin/issues/55)

  From now on the expectation is that code in groovy directories will be compiled using the Groovy compiler for both Java and Groovy code colocated. Java code in a java directory will be compiled using the Java compiler. Previously when Groovy was installed all code was compiled with Groovy without care.

* Use TestKit for defining and executing functional tests- [Issue 80](https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-clover-plugin/issues/80)

  Enabled the use of Gradle TestKit for functional testing. This eliminated the dependency on arcane logic in the build.gradle files that set plugin classpaths in weird ways.

* Automate release process following gradle-docker-plugin scheme- [Issue 96](https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-clover-plugin/issues/96)

  The changes to include the refined Gradle build logic from the Docker plugin were integrated.  We should have a semi-automatic release process now based on tag pushing.

Other changes:

Removed the support for Clover license. Only support OpenClover.

Cleaned up the Java test code in all functional test data
projects to use Junit 4 annotations instead of Junit 3.

### Version 2.1.3 (September 19, 2017)

New properties supported in method context filtering.

See the documentation in [README.md](README.md) for the new usage.
* `testResultsDir`: Specifies the location of the JUnit4 test results XML report.
* `testResultsInclude`: Ant file Glob pattern to select Junit4 test results (defaults to TEST-*.xml).
